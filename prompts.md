I want to write a C++ program to record audio. to do so, I have made my setup ready, I use Fedora KDE system and I use GCC compiler. I work in vs code and I have my compiler and debugging ready. 
Now I want you to help me write my program so that:

1- I add JUCE library


2- I detect the hardware in linux terminal (Input and Output channels)


3- Writing a program in C++ to test the channels:
a) play tone on channels I select with index to test it
b) record from a channel I select with index, putting in buffers (using arrays in C++) and just save it to a .wav file so I play using a player outside.
use buffers for playback and recording so later I can expand upon filtering.
